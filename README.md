# Cook County Housing Price Prediction 

This project explores housing price prediction in **Cook County, Illinois**, using a rich dataset embedded in a dense social context.  
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and linear modeling, we aim to understand the underlying drivers of housing prices and evaluate predictive performance.

## Project Overview  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Investigated dataset structure, distributions, and relationships between features and housing prices.  
   - Visualized key housing trends in Cook County.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Added new predictive features to enhance model accuracy.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Implemented a **Linear Regression model** for housing price prediction.  
   - Achieved **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.41**.  

4. **Evaluation & Insights**  
   - Analyzed model errors to identify strengths and limitations.  
   - Proposed strategies (e.g., nonlinear models, additional features) to further improve performance.
